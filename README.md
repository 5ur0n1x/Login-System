# **Login System by Redhart** #

This is actually my first Qt 5 project driven by SQLite3.
I was basically cloning a PHP/MySQL authentication system I wrote earlier when I arrived at this idea.


This app currently has the following features:

- Registration/Login

- Profile System

- Avatar System

- Edit Profile/Password

- Delete Own Account

- Basic GUI

While this app is driven by an SQLite database, it is targeted at a unified database server.
Yes, one can always serve the s3db file over the network but why bother when MySQL basically does this?

Choice is always yours. ![E057.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/azAkE8/images/3065839784-E057.png)
